Fish Life Prediction Project Brief
Objective:
The project aims to predict the life status of fish based on various water parameters using machine learning algorithms in Python.

Dataset:
The dataset comprises observations of water parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc., along with the corresponding fish life status. It contains attributes like NITRATE(PPM), PH, AMMONIA(mg/l), and
using attributes built a  target variable is 'Fish_disease ' like

fish_conditions = [ df1['NITRATE(PPM)'] >= 100, (df1['PH'] >= 4.8) & (df1['PH'] <= 6.5),
df1['AMMONIA(mg/l)'] >= 0.05, (df1['TEMP'] >= 12) & (df1['TEMP'] <= 15),
df1['DO'] <= 3, df1['TURBIDITY'] <= 12, df1['MANGANESE(mg/l)'] <= 1.0 ]
# Assign 1 if at least two conditions are met, 0 otherwise
df1['FISH_DISEASE'] = (np.sum(fish_conditions, axis=0) >= 2).astype(int).

Workflow:
Data Preparation:

Loading the dataset using Python's pandas library.
Cleaning the data by handling missing values and converting data types.
Feature Engineering:

Extracting relevant features from the dataset.
Converting timestamps to numerical representations or extracting date/time features.
Model Training:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Employing machine learning models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) to train on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Making predictions on the test set.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve analysis.
Visualizing performance metrics with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
Structure:
Utilizes Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Contains a Jupyter Notebook (fish_life_prediction.ipynb) with code and analysis.
Utilizes a dataset (your_dataset.csv) with relevant columns for analysis.
Usage:
Setup:

Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
Download the provided dataset (your_dataset.csv) and place it in the project directory.
Execution:

Open and run the fish_life_prediction.ipynb notebook.
Follow the instructions to load, preprocess, train models, and evaluate performance.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict fish life status based on water parameters. It provides insights into feature importance and model performance, aiding in predictive analysis for fish life in varying water conditions.
